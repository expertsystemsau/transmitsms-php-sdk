Laravel notification channel and integration for the [Kudosity API](https://kudosity.com/).
This is the 2.x line — see [UPGRADING.md](../../UPGRADING.md) if you're
migrating from 1.x.

## Installation

```bash
composer require expertsystemsau/kudosity-laravel-client
```

Publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="kudosity-config"
```

## Configuration

Add your credentials to your `.env` file:

```env
KUDOSITY_API_KEY=your-api-key
KUDOSITY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
# Optional default sender ID — see "Sender IDs" below before setting this
KUDOSITY_FROM=
```

### Sender IDs

`KUDOSITY_FROM` (or the per-message `from()` / `from` option) is the sender ID
recipients see. It can be:

- A **dedicated virtual number (VMN)** in international format, e.g. `61491570012` —
  supports two-way messaging (recipients can reply).
- An **alphanumeric sender ID** ("alpha tag") such as `MyBrand` — max 11 characters,
  letters and digits only, no spaces. One-way only; recipients cannot reply.
- **Omitted** (leave empty) — Kudosity falls back to a shared number for the
  destination country.

> ⚠️ **Alpha tags must be registered and approved before you can send with them.**
> For messages to Australian numbers, alphanumeric sender IDs must be listed on the
> [ACMA SMS Sender ID Register](https://www.acma.gov.au/sms-sender-id-register)
> (enforced from 1 July 2026) — an unregistered sender ID is replaced with
> **"Unverified"** on the recipient's device. Registration requires your registered
> entity name, ABN, and an authorised contact. Register your sender IDs through the
> Kudosity dashboard before setting `KUDOSITY_FROM`; until then, leave it empty
> to send from a shared number.

## Usage

### Facade

The facade proxies to the resource-based client, and **V2 is where new work
belongs**. `sms()`, `mms()`, `whatsapp()` and `rcs()` are the four V2 channels:
one recipient each, sent immediately. `webhooks()` manages the account-level
webhook that delivery receipts and replies arrive through, and `senders()` reads
sender registrations.

V1 is not deprecated — it covers everything V2 cannot express. Contact lists,
multi-recipient sends, scheduling and validity windows live on `bulk()`;
reporting and account operations are V1 only.

```php
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Laravel\Facades\Kudosity;

// V2 — one recipient, sent now. message_ref is your correlation key.
Kudosity::sms()->send('Hello from Laravel!', '61491570006', '61491570017', messageRef: 'order-9931');
Kudosity::whatsapp()->text('Hi from WhatsApp!', '61491570010');

// V1 — multiple recipients, contact lists, scheduling
Kudosity::bulk()->send('Hello!', '+61491570006,+61491570007');

// Reporting and account operations are V1 only
$balance = Kudosity::account()->getBalance();
```

### Notifications

Create a notification that uses the Kudosity channel:

```php
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Laravel\Notifications\KudosityMessage;

class OrderShipped extends Notification
{
    public function via($notifiable): array
    {
        return ['kudosity'];
    }

    public function toKudosity($notifiable): KudosityMessage
    {
        return KudosityMessage::create('Your order has been shipped!')
            ->from('MyStore');
    }
}
```

Add the `routeNotificationForKudosity` method to your notifiable model:

```php
class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Notifiable;

    public function routeNotificationForKudosity($notification): ?string
    {
        return $this->phone_number;
    }
}
```

Then send notifications:

```php
$user->notify(new OrderShipped());
```

### Message options

`KudosityMessage` is a fluent builder covering every send option:

```php
KudosityMessage::create('Your order has shipped!')
    ->from('MyStore')                         // sender ID (else config/default)
    ->countryCode('AU')                       // normalise local numbers…
    ->formatNumbers();                        // …when this asks it to
```

Several options exist on only one of the two APIs, and the builder refuses to
drop one silently rather than sending a message that is quietly not what you
asked for:

```php
// V1-only — setting any of these routes the whole message to V1
    ->validity(60)                            // minutes to attempt delivery
    ->sendAt('2026-12-25 09:00:00')           // schedule
    ->repliesToEmail('inbox@example.com')     // route replies to an email
    ->trackedLinkUrl('https://example.com')   // the [tracked-link] target

// V2-only — setting either of these on a message that routes to V1 THROWS
    ->messageRef('order-9931:cust-4471')      // your correlation key
    ->trackLinks()                            // shorten the URLs in the body
```

`trackedLinkUrl()` and `trackLinks()` are **not** two spellings of one feature.
V1 substitutes `tracked_link_url` into a `[tracked-link]` placeholder in the
body; V2's `track_links` is a boolean that shortens URLs already written into
the message. Setting both is asking for two APIs at once, and throws.

### Number formatting

`countryCode()` and `formatNumbers()` work on both APIs and must be set
together — a country alone normalises nothing, and `formatNumbers()` alone has
no country to normalise against. That pairing is deliberate: **the SDK never
guesses a country**, because guessing wrong sends a real message to a real
stranger rather than failing.

Without them the recipient is passed through with punctuation stripped and any
leading zero left intact, for the API to accept or reject on its own terms.
`POST /v2/sms` does accept a local number — but it resolves the country against
*your account*, so on an account sending across borders the country you did not
name is the country you do not get.

An unparseable recipient is now refused rather than formatted into something
plausible: `PhoneNumber::toInternational()` throws instead of turning `abc123`
into `61123`. Through a notification that surfaces as a `KudosityException`.

To send to a Kudosity contact list instead of the notifiable's number, use
`toList()` — the resolved recipient is then ignored:

```php
public function toKudosity($notifiable): KudosityMessage
{
    return KudosityMessage::create('Flash sale for members!')
        ->toList(12345);
}
```

## The four notification channels

| Channel | Notification method | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| `kudosity` | `toKudosity()` | `POST /v2/sms`, or V1 `send-sms.json` — see routing below |
| `kudosity-mms` | `toKudosityMms()` | `POST /v2/mms` |
| `kudosity-whatsapp` | `toKudosityWhatsApp()` | `POST /v2/whatsapp/messages` |
| `kudosity-rcs` | `toKudosityRcs()` | `POST /v2/rcs/messages` |

```php
public function via($notifiable): array
{
    return ['kudosity-mms'];
}

public function toKudosityMms($notifiable): KudosityMmsMessage
{
    return KudosityMmsMessage::create('Your order shipped')
        ->media('https://example.com/tracking.png')   // exactly one media file
        ->subject('Shipped');                         // max 20 ASCII characters
}

public function toKudosityWhatsApp($notifiable): KudosityWhatsAppMessage
{
    // template(), not text(), if this might be the first message — free-form
    // text only delivers inside the 24-hour service window.
    return KudosityWhatsAppMessage::create()
        ->template('order_update', ['ACME', '#12345'])
        ->smsFallback('Your order shipped.');
}

public function toKudosityRcs($notifiable): KudosityRcsMessage
{
    // agentId() is a registered AGENT ID, never a phone number.
    return KudosityRcsMessage::create('Your order shipped')
        ->agentId('DemoSender')
        ->smsFallback('Your order shipped.');
}
```

Each channel takes its sender from its own config key — `mms.sender`,
`whatsapp.sender`, `rcs.agent_id` — because they are not the same kind of value.
An alphanumeric sender that works for SMS is not a valid MMS sender, and an RCS
sender is an agent ID rather than a number at all. WhatsApp deliberately sends
**no** sender when none is configured, letting the account default apply, because
an SMS sender ID would be rejected.

### How the SMS channel chooses an API

V2 by default. V1 only when the message uses something V2 cannot express:

| Trigger | Why |
|---|---|
| `toList()` | V2 has no list send |
| `sendAt()` | `POST /v2/sms` cannot schedule |
| `validity()`, `repliesToEmail()` | V1-only options |
| `dlrCallback()`, `replyCallback()`, `linkHitsCallback()` | **V2 has no per-send callback URL at all** |
| `onDlr()`, `onReply()`, `onLinkHit()` | the handler forms become those same callbacks |
| `trackedLinkUrl()` | V1 substitutes it into `[tracked-link]`; V2 has no placeholder to substitute into |
| more than one recipient in `to()` | `POST /v2/sms` takes exactly one |

The decision runs the other way too. `messageRef()` and `trackLinks()` exist
only on V2, so a message setting either **and** routing to V1 throws rather than
sending without it — a dropped `message_ref` is a send that succeeds and then
produces webhooks nobody can correlate, which is a silence rather than an error.

The decision is inspectable rather than magic:

```php
$message->apiVersion();   // ApiVersion::V2 | ApiVersion::V1
$message->v1Reasons();    // [] — or e.g. ['sendAt()', 'validity()']
$message->forceV1();
$message->forceV2();      // THROWS if a V1-only option is set
```

`forceV2()` throwing is deliberate: silently dropping a `sendAt()` turns a
scheduled send into an immediate one — a wrong send rather than a failed one.

`send()` returns `Contracts\SentMessage`, not a concrete DTO, because the routing
decision is made inside the channel:

```php
$sent->id();              // V2 UUID, or the V1 message_id as a string
$sent->recipientCount();  // 1 for V2; the V1 recipients count otherwise
$sent->status();          // null for every V1 send — V1 reports no status
```

## Receiving V2 webhooks

`POST {prefix}/events` handles all ten V2 event types and dispatches one of four
typed events. **The three V1 GET callback routes are unchanged** and still handle
V1 sends — V2 has no per-send callback URL, so a send migrated from `bulk()` to
`sms()` silently stops reporting until a webhook is registered.

> **Register listeners once — not twice.** Laravel 11 and 12 auto-discover
> class-based listeners in `app/Listeners`. If you *also* register them
> explicitly with `Event::listen()`, every event is dispatched to your listener
> **twice**, and for a webhook receiver that means duplicated rows and duplicated

> class-based listeners. The hazard appears when you move to a listener class.

```php
Event::listen(KudosityStatusReceived::class, function (KudosityStatusReceived $e) {
    // Deliveries are at-least-once AND unordered. A SENT redelivered 57 seconds
    // after DELIVERED has been observed on a live account.
    if (StatusPrecedence::supersedes($e->status->status, $this->recorded($e->status->id))) {
        $this->record($e->status->id, $e->status->status);
    }
});

Event::listen(KudosityInboundReceived::class, function (KudosityInboundReceived $e) {
    // Route on the ref, never the number. And $e->inbound->sender is the
    // CUSTOMER; $e->inbound->recipient is your own number.
    //
    // Guard on the ref itself, NOT on isCorrelated(): that reports whether
    // Kudosity attached a last_message, which it does whenever it finds a recent
    // outbound to the number — with or without a message_ref on it. A message
    // sent without one passes isCorrelated() and then routes on null.
    if (($ref = $e->inbound->messageRef()) === null) {
        return;   // nothing to correlate against
    }

    $this->route($ref, $e->inbound->message);
});
```

Also `KudosityLinkHitReceived` and `KudosityOptOutReceived`. A link hit is **not**
evidence a human clicked — the first hit routinely arrives in the same second as
`DELIVERED`, because messaging apps fetch link previews.

### Authenticity

**V2 deliveries carry no signature** — no HMAC, no auth header. The route is
protected only by its unguessable URL, whose signature travels in the query
string; an unsigned request gets a 403. That is why `install` below must build the
URL rather than you writing it by hand.

To establish that a delivery refers to one of *your* entities, sign the
`message_ref` on the way out and verify it on the way in with
`Webhooks\SignedMessageRef`. That protects **correlation, not the payload**.

```php
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Webhooks\SignedMessageRef;

// On the way out — messageRef() is V2-only, so a message that routes to V1
// throws here rather than sending without the key.
public function toKudosity($notifiable): KudosityMessage
{
    return KudosityMessage::create('Your order has shipped!')
        ->messageRef(SignedMessageRef::sign("order-{$this->order->id}", config('kudosity.signing_key')));
}

// On the way in
Event::listen(KudosityStatusReceived::class, function (KudosityStatusReceived $e) {
    $entity = SignedMessageRef::verify($e->status->messageRef, config('kudosity.signing_key'));

    if ($entity === null) {
        return;   // unsigned, forged, or for another system
    }
});
```

Parsing splits on the **last** colon, so composite refs survive. Max 500
characters, enforced before the request leaves the process.

## Artisan commands

```bash
php artisan kudosity:webhook:list

# The declarative one — put this in your deploy script. Running it twice
# registers one webhook, not two.
php artisan kudosity:webhook:sync

# The imperative one-shot, for registering an ADDITIONAL, differently filtered
# webhook. Creates a new registration every time it runs.
php artisan kudosity:webhook:install --event=SMS_STATUS --event=SMS_INBOUND
php artisan kudosity:webhook:install --name="Prod events" --rate-limit=250

php artisan kudosity:webhook:delete {id} --force
```

`sync` is idempotent and repairs drift `install` cannot see, but only some of
it in place. Rotating `KUDOSITY_SIGNING_KEY` or `APP_KEY`, or changing which
events you subscribe to, updates the existing registration and keeps its id —
without this, it keeps receiving deliveries the receiver then rejects with a
403, and Kudosity has no channel to tell you your endpoint is refusing them.
Changing `kudosity.webhooks.prefix` or moving `APP_URL` is different: the path
and host are part of the registration's identity, so the old one becomes a
**different endpoint**. `sync` registers a new webhook for it and leaves the
old one running — nothing here deletes, and the stale registration will not
appear in the duplicate warning either, since that only covers registrations
sharing the *current* identity. Those old deliveries 404 (the path no longer
routes) rather than 403 (a stale signature on a path that still routes). Run
`kudosity:webhook:list` after either change and remove the stale row with
`kudosity:webhook:delete`. It reports duplicate registrations pointing at the
same receiver without deleting any of them.

`sync` calls `ensure()` with no fingerprint store
(`WebhookSyncCommand.php:62-68`), so every run reconciles against the API
directly rather than trusting a cached fingerprint — the hazard described in
the client package's README fingerprint section (a store that outlives a
dashboard edit) does not apply here.

`install` and `sync` both reject an unrecognised `--event` rather than
registering a webhook that would deliver nothing — they share the validation
through `ResolvesEventTypes`. Omit `--event` entirely to receive all ten types.

**HTTPS is required for any real environment.** A plaintext `http://` receiver is
permitted only when `APP_ENV=local` — local development often has no TLS and the
traffic never leaves the machine — and the command warns when it takes that path.
Anywhere else, a plaintext `APP_URL` is refused with an explanation.

### Only permitted environments may write

`sync`, `install` and `delete` all write account-level registrations, and they
refuse to run outside `kudosity.webhooks.sync.environments`, which defaults to
`['production']`. **This is new in 2.3.0 and changes behaviour for existing
setups**: an `install` you used to run from staging now refuses.

Registrations belong to the *account*, not the app. If one Kudosity account
backs several environments, a webhook registered from staging receives the
whole account's events — every production delivery receipt and inbound reply,
message bodies and phone numbers included. When those environments also share a
sender, no webhook filter can partition that traffic.

The list **fails closed**: an empty list, or a config published before this
feature existed and therefore missing the key entirely, refuses every
environment. There is no command-line override, and `--force` on `delete` still
only skips the confirmation prompt. `kudosity:webhook:list` is read-only and
stays ungated.

If several of your deployments share one Kudosity account and sender, each
receiver will be delivered events for messages the others sent. Write listeners
that treat an unrecognised `message_ref` as ordinary rather than an error worth
alerting on.

## DLR & Reply Callbacks (V1)

> **This is the V1 mechanism, and using it routes your message to V1.**
> `onDlr()`, `onReply()` and `onLinkHit()` become per-send callback URLs, which
> `POST /v2/sms` has no room for — so a notification using any of them is sent
> over V1 in full, with V1's auth, host and response shape.
>
> For new work prefer the account-level webhook receiver documented under
> [Receiving V2 webhooks](#receiving-v2-webhooks) above: one registration serves
> every channel, and correlation runs on `messageRef()` rather than on a job
> bound to a single send. This section remains fully supported and is the right
> choice when you are already on V1 for another reason — a list send, a schedule
> — or when per-send handler context is genuinely what you want.

The package provides automatic handling for DLR (Delivery Receipt), Reply, and Link Hit callbacks. When you send an SMS, you can specify a job to be dispatched when a callback is received.

### Quick Start

```php
use App\Jobs\UpdateOrderSmsStatusJob;
use App\Jobs\ProcessCustomerReplyJob;
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Laravel\Notifications\KudosityMessage;

class OrderShipped extends Notification
{
    public function __construct(public Order $order) {}

    public function via($notifiable): array
    {
        return ['kudosity'];
    }

    public function toKudosity($notifiable): KudosityMessage
    {
        return KudosityMessage::create("Your order #{$this->order->id} has shipped!")
            ->from('MYSTORE')
            ->onDlr(UpdateOrderSmsStatusJob::class, [
                'order_id' => $this->order->id,
            ])
            ->onReply(ProcessCustomerReplyJob::class, [
                'order_id' => $this->order->id,
                'customer_id' => $notifiable->id,
            ]);
    }
}
```

### Creating Handler Jobs

**DLR Handler Job:**

```php
namespace App\Jobs;

use App\Models\Order;
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Data\DlrCallbackData;
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Laravel\Contracts\HandlesDlrCallback;
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;

class UpdateOrderSmsStatusJob implements HandlesDlrCallback, ShouldQueue
{
    use InteractsWithQueue, Queueable;

    public function __construct(
        public DlrCallbackData $dlr,
        public array $context,
    ) {}

    public function handle(): void
    {
        $order = Order::find($this->context['order_id']);

        $order->update([
            'sms_status' => $this->dlr->status,
            'sms_delivered_at' => $this->dlr->isDelivered()
                ? now()->parse($this->dlr->datetime)
                : null,
        ]);

        if ($this->dlr->isFailed()) {
            // Handle failure - maybe send email instead
            Log::warning('SMS delivery failed', [
                'order_id' => $order->id,
                'error' => $this->dlr->errorDescription,
            ]);
        }
    }
}
```

**Reply Handler Job:**

```php
namespace App\Jobs;

use App\Models\SmsConversation;
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Data\ReplyCallbackData;
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Laravel\Contracts\HandlesReplyCallback;
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;

class ProcessCustomerReplyJob implements HandlesReplyCallback, ShouldQueue
{
    use Queueable;

    public function __construct(
        public ReplyCallbackData $reply,
        public array $context,
    ) {}

    public function handle(): void
    {
        SmsConversation::create([
            'order_id' => $this->context['order_id'],
            'customer_id' => $this->context['customer_id'],
            'direction' => 'inbound',
            'message' => $this->reply->message,
            'mobile' => $this->reply->mobile,
            'received_at' => $this->reply->receivedAt,
        ]);
    }
}
```

**Link Hit Handler Job:**

```php
namespace App\Jobs;

use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Data\LinkHitCallbackData;
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Laravel\Contracts\HandlesLinkHitCallback;
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;

class TrackLinkClickJob implements HandlesLinkHitCallback, ShouldQueue
{
    use Queueable;

    public function __construct(
        public LinkHitCallbackData $linkHit,
        public array $context,
    ) {}

    public function handle(): void
    {
        LinkClick::create([
            'campaign_id' => $this->context['campaign_id'],
            'mobile' => $this->linkHit->mobile,
            'url' => $this->linkHit->url,
            'clicked_at' => $this->linkHit->clickedAt,
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Global Event Listeners

In addition to per-message handlers, you can listen to events for all callbacks:

```php
// App\Providers\EventServiceProvider.php
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Laravel\Events\DlrReceived;
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Laravel\Events\ReplyReceived;
use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Laravel\Events\LinkHitReceived;

protected $listen = [
    DlrReceived::class => [
        \App\Listeners\LogDlrCallback::class,
    ],
    ReplyReceived::class => [
        \App\Listeners\LogReplyCallback::class,
    ],
    LinkHitReceived::class => [
        \App\Listeners\LogLinkHitCallback::class,
    ],
];
```

Example listener:

```php
namespace App\Listeners;

use ExpertSystems\Kudosity\Laravel\Events\DlrReceived;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class LogDlrCallback
{
    public function handle(DlrReceived $event): void
    {
        Log::info('DLR callback received', [
            'message_id' => $event->dlr->messageId,
            'mobile' => $event->dlr->mobile,
            'status' => $event->dlr->status,
            'context' => $event->context,
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Webhook Configuration

The webhook routes are automatically registered. You can customize them in `config/kudosity.php`:

```php
'webhooks' => [
    // Enable/disable webhook routes
    'enabled' => env('KUDOSITY_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED', true),

    // Route prefix (e.g., /webhooks/kudosity/dlr)
    'prefix' => env('KUDOSITY_WEBHOOKS_PREFIX', 'webhooks/kudosity'),

    // Middleware for webhook routes
    'middleware' => ['api'],

    // Custom signing key (defaults to APP_KEY)
    'signing_key' => env('KUDOSITY_SIGNING_KEY'),

    // DLR callback settings
    'dlr' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'path' => 'dlr',
        'queue' => env('KUDOSITY_DLR_QUEUE', 'default'),
    ],

    // Reply callback settings
    'reply' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'path' => 'reply',
        'queue' => env('KUDOSITY_REPLY_QUEUE', 'default'),
    ],

    // Link hits callback settings
    'link_hits' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'path' => 'link-hits',
        'queue' => env('KUDOSITY_LINK_HITS_QUEUE', 'default'),
    ],
],
```

### Callback Data Objects

**DlrCallbackData** properties:

### How It Works

1. **Sending**: When you use `onDlr()`, `onReply()`, or `onLinkHit()`, the package builds a signed callback URL containing your handler class and context data.

2. **Receiving**: When Kudosity calls the webhook, the package:
   - Verifies the HMAC signature
   - Parses the callback data into a DTO
   - Dispatches a global event (for logging/monitoring)
   - Dispatches your handler job with the data and context

3. **Security**: The callback URL includes an HMAC signature to prevent tampering. Only callbacks with valid signatures are processed.
