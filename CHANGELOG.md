# Changelog

All notable changes to `kudosity-php-client` will be documented in this file.

## 2.4.0 - 2026-08-25

Correlation on the SMS notification channel, and three silent-drop defects around
phone numbers and link tracking. **Minor, not patch** — two changes reject input
that 2.3 accepted, and one moves a message between APIs.

### ⚠️ Behaviour changes

- **`trackedLinkUrl()` now routes an SMS notification to V1.** It was absent from
  `KudosityMessage::v1OnlyOptions()`, so a message setting it routed to V2 — which
  has no `[tracked-link]` placeholder to substitute into. The body reached the
  handset with the literal `[tracked-link]` in it and the URL nowhere at all.
  V1 is the only API with the mechanism, so that is where such a message goes.
  A message combining it with `forceV2()` now throws.

- **`PhoneNumber::toInternational()` refuses unparseable input** instead of
  formatting it. Its return type could not express failure, so it manufactured
  plausible-looking numbers: `abc123` with a country of `AU` came back as
  `61123`, and the caller then read an API error naming a number they never
  wrote. It now throws `InvalidArgumentException` when the input carries no
  digits, or when the formatted result fails its own `isValid()`.

  A **leading `+` is now honoured as "already international"** and is never
  re-prefixed. This is the one that mattered: `+447911123456` on an account
  configured for AU became `61447911123456` — fourteen digits, which `isValid()`
  accepts. A well-formed number for the wrong country is a wrong send, not a
  failed one.

  The guard is deliberately **not** a national-format oracle. Short codes and
  local formats the API delivers happily are still accepted, because a false
  rejection is a message that never goes out.

### Added

- **`KudosityMessage::messageRef()`** — the correlation key on the SMS
  notification channel. `sendViaV2()` hardcoded `messageRef: null`, so the
  `kudosity` channel was the only V2 surface in the package where a send could
  not be correlated: `SignedMessageRef` had nothing to sign, and the inbound
  listener both READMEs document read `null` on every reply. MMS, WhatsApp and
  RCS have carried a ref since 2.0.

- **`KudosityMessage::trackLinks()`** — V2's link shortening, a boolean over the
  URLs already in the body. `sendViaV2()` previously derived it from
  `getTrackedLinkUrl() !== null`, conflating two different mechanisms.

- Both are **V2-only**: set either on a message that routes to V1 and
  `apiVersion()` throws, naming every option that forced V1. The mirror of the
  existing `forceV2()` throw, and for the same reason — a dropped `message_ref`
  is a send that succeeds and then produces webhooks nobody can correlate.

### Fixed

- **`countryCode()` and `formatNumbers()` are honoured on the V2 route.** Neither
  was in `v1OnlyOptions()`, so a message setting them routed to V2 and was sent
  raw. `POST /v2/sms` accepts a local number but resolves the country
  **server-side against the account** — so the caller named a country, the SDK
  discarded it, and the API guessed. The condition now mirrors the V1 request's
  exactly.

- **`KUDOSITY_COUNTRY_CODE` is wired into the V1 connector.** The key was
  published and documented from 2.0 and read by nothing: `KudosityServiceProvider`
  called `setDefaultFrom()` and never `setDefaultCountryCode()`, so
  `bulk()->formatNumberLocal()` fell back to "no country" and normalised nothing.

- **V2 SMS and MMS normalise the recipient** the way WhatsApp and RCS always
  have — punctuation stripped, any leading zero left for the API to resolve. The
  same stored number no longer behaves differently depending on which channel a
  notification uses.

- **`UPGRADING.md`'s environment variable table** said `TRANSMITSMS_BASE_URL` →
  `KUDOSITY_BASE_URL`. There is no such variable: the config reads
  `KUDOSITY_BASE_URL_V1` and `KUDOSITY_BASE_URL_V2`. A `KUDOSITY_BASE_URL` in an
  `.env` is read by nothing — it does not throw, V1 silently falls back to the
  default host. The codemod always rewrote this correctly; only a hand migration
  could get it wrong. The new variables added in 2.x are now listed too.

- Both READMEs now lead with V2 and move the V1 surface after it. The Laravel
  package README described V2 as "upcoming", and its webhook example guarded on
  `isCorrelated()` before routing on `messageRef()` — which reports whether
  Kudosity attached a `last_message`, not whether that message carried a ref, so
  the guard passed and the route ran on `null`.

## 2.3.0 - 2026-08-10

Idempotent V2 webhook registration. The failure this addresses is **drift, not
absence**: the receiver URL carries an HMAC signature, so rotating
`KUDOSITY_SIGNING_KEY` or `APP_KEY`, or changing the subscribed event set, leaves
a registration that still exists and still receives deliveries — every one of
which the receiver then rejects with a 403 that Kudosity has no channel to report
back to you. A "does a registration exist?" check passes in every one of those
cases.

### ⚠️ Action required when upgrading a Laravel app with a published config

`kudosity:webhook:sync`, `:install` and `:delete` now refuse to run unless the
current environment is listed in **`kudosity.webhooks.sync.environments`**, which
ships as `['production']`.

`mergeConfigFrom` is a single-level merge, so a `config/kudosity.php` published
before this release supplies the whole `webhooks` array and that key is **absent
entirely** — which means those three commands refuse in *every* environment,
production included, until you add it. That is deliberate fail-closed behaviour,
not a bug. `kudosity:webhook:list` is read-only and stays ungated.

The reason it fails closed: registrations are **account-level**. If one Kudosity
account backs several environments, a webhook registered from staging receives
the whole account's events — every production delivery receipt and inbound reply,
message bodies and phone numbers included. When those environments share a sender,
no webhook filter can partition that traffic, so this allowlist is the only
control. It has no command-line override; `--force` on `delete` still only skips
the confirmation prompt.

### Added

- **`WebhooksResource::ensure()`** — lists the account, matches your registration
  by a normalised receiver identity, then creates, `PUT`-replaces, or does
  nothing. Safe to run on every deploy. Returns
  `EnsureResult{action, ?webhook, duplicates}` where `action` is `created`,
  `updated`, `unchanged` or `skipped`. It **never deletes**, and never modifies a
  registration whose identity differs from the URL you passed.

- **`Webhooks\WebhookIdentity`** — that identity: scheme, userinfo, host, port and
  path, **never the query string**, because the query is where the signature lives
  and therefore the part that drifts. Userinfo participates so a credentialed
  foreign registration (`https://user:token@host/path`) cannot match an
  uncredentialed one and get overwritten; any password is reduced to a `:***`
  marker, because this string becomes a key in an on-disk store.

- **`Contracts\WebhookFingerprintStore`** and **`Webhooks\FileFingerprintStore`** —
  optional, off by default, letting a caller skip the list request when nothing
  changed. Two methods, no new dependency. **Read the caveat below before using
  it.**

- **`kudosity:webhook:sync`** (Laravel) — the declarative counterpart to
  `install`. Put it in your deploy script: running it twice registers one webhook,
  not two. `install` remains the imperative one-shot for registering an
  additional, differently-filtered webhook.

### Two limits worth knowing before you rely on this

- **A changed route prefix or a moved `APP_URL` is not repaired in place.** Path
  and host are part of the identity, so changing either makes the old
  registration a *different endpoint*: `sync` registers a new one and leaves the
  old one alone. It will not appear in `duplicates` either, which is
  same-identity only. Nothing here deletes. Run `kudosity:webhook:list` after
  either change and remove the stale row yourself — its deliveries now 404
  against a path that no longer routes. Only a rotated signing key and a changed
  event set are repaired in place, preserving the registration id.

- **A fingerprint store records that *you* already reconciled a desired state. It
  says nothing about what the account currently holds.** If the registration is
  deleted or edited in the Kudosity dashboard while your desired state is
  unchanged, `ensure()` returns `skipped` and never repairs. Pass no store if
  registrations can change outside your own deploy — a dashboard edit, another
  environment, a colleague. `kudosity:webhook:sync` passes no store, so Laravel
  users are not exposed to this.

### Changed

- `expertsystemsau/kudosity-laravel-client` now requires
  `expertsystemsau/kudosity-php-client: ^2.3`, because the Laravel package uses
  `EnsureAction`, `EnsureResult` and `ensure()`, all new here. Under the previous
  `^2.0` Composer could have paired this release with a 2.0.x client and fatalled
  at runtime.

## 2.2.0 - 2026-08-10

Clears the remaining follow-ups deferred from the 2026-08 live validation. Every
field name below was **verified against the live API**, not taken from the docs —
six of the eight defects fixed in 2.0.2 were one-word field-name mismatches, and
a hand-written fixture encodes the same wrong guess as the code.

### Added

- **`SmsStatsData` exposes four fields it was discarding**: `hardBounced`,
  `softBounced`, `linkHits` and `recipientCount`. The API returned all four and
  the DTO dropped them.

  `recipientCount` counts distinct recipients where `sent` counts SMS parts, so
  a long message to one recipient reports `sent > recipientCount`. Note the API
  spells this one **`recipientCount` in camelCase** while every sibling key is
  snake_case — do not "correct" it.

  `linkHits` counts machine fetches too: a messaging app's link preview
  registers as a hit, so it is not an engagement metric.

- **`BulkProgressData` exposes four fields it was discarding**: `imported`,
  `duplicates`, `skipped` and `optout`. Verified with a deliberately mixed
  2-row import (one valid number, one invalid) so the counts could not be
  confused by all being equal: `importlength` counts every row including
  invalid ones, `completed` counts rows processed, and `imported` counts only
  rows added.

  `errors` is now `@deprecated` — it was always 0, because the API has no field
  by that name. `skipped` is the real failed-row count.

- **`ReportingResource::getContactRecords()`** — a lazy paginator over the
  per-message delivery records `get-contact-sms-stats.json` actually returns.
  Call `->items()` to walk rows; iterating the paginator itself yields one
  `Response` per page.

- **`Data\ContactSmsRecordData`** and **`Data\ContactSmsSummaryData`**.

- **`MmsMessageData`, `WhatsAppMessageData` and `RcsMessageData` now implement
  `Contracts\SentMessage`**, joining `SmsMessageData`. A consumer can finally
  write one function that handles a send across all four channels. Every V2 send
  endpoint takes exactly one recipient, so `recipientCount()` is 1 throughout;
  WhatsApp and RCS keep a nullable `status()` because the API omits it on some
  reads.

### Fixed

- **`getContactStats()` no longer throws on every call.** Since 2.0.2 it threw
  unconditionally: the endpoint returns `{page, total, records[]}`, a per-message
  record list, not the aggregate shape `ContactSmsStatsData` modelled. It now
  pages through the records and tallies `delivery_status`.

### Changed

- **`getContactStats()` returns `ContactSmsSummaryData`, not
  `ContactSmsStatsData`**, and takes a new optional `$maxRecords`. Not treated as
  a breaking change because the previous return value was unreachable — the
  method threw on every real response, so no working consumer can exist.

  The new DTO deliberately reports **only what the records support**. The old one
  carried `responses` and `optouts`, and a record contains just `message_id`,
  `datetime_send` and `delivery_status` — those two counts cannot be derived at
  all, and returning 0 would be indistinguishable from a real zero.

- **`getContactStatsRequest()` returns a paginator** rather than a DTO, for the
  same reason.

- `getContactStats()` reads **every page** to produce a total. Pass `$maxRecords`
  to cap it; the result is then flagged `complete: false` and its counts are a
  lower bound, not totals.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Laravel 13 support.** `illuminate/notifications` and `illuminate/support` on
  the Laravel package widen to `^11.0||^12.0||^13.0`, and `orchestra/testbench`
  to `^9.0||^10.0||^11.0`. This resolves the 2.0.2 known issue, where
  `composer require` failed outright on a fresh Laravel 13 install — the failure
  every new adopter hit on their first command.

  **No source changes were needed.** The full Laravel suite (168 tests) and
  PHPStan level 6 both pass unmodified against Laravel 13.24.0 / Testbench
  11.1.0, with no deprecations, warnings or risky tests. The package's Laravel
  surface — service-provider registration, `ChannelManager::extend()` via
  `Notification::resolved()`, the four channel `send()` signatures, and webhook
  route registration — is unchanged in 13.

  `saloonphp/laravel-plugin` already declared `^13.0` as of v4.3.0, so the
  blocker was never upstream.

- Laravel 13 / Testbench 11 added to the CI matrix as a first-class entry, on
  PHP 8.3 and 8.4.

### Notes

- **The PHP floor stays at `^8.2`.** Laravel 13 itself requires `^8.3`, but that
  needs no exclusion: Composer resolves per consumer, so a PHP 8.2 consumer
  installs Laravel 12 and a PHP 8.3+ consumer may install 13. Both paths were
  verified by resolving the package standalone under each platform. Raising the
  floor to `^8.3` is a breaking change and is deferred to 3.0; PHP 8.2 security
  support ends 2026-12-31.

## 2.0.2 - 2026-08-09

Bug fixes only, no new features and no signature or property changes. Every
defect below was found by installing the published packages into two fresh
applications and driving them against the live API — not by a unit test, which
is the point: six of the seven are one-word field-name mismatches, and a
hand-written fixture encodes the same wrong assumption as the code.

### Fixed

- **`V2PagedPaginator` silently dropped every page after the second.** The API
  reports `total_records` correctly on page 1 and as `"0"` on later pages even
  when they hold items, so `ceil(0/limit)` concluded "last page" one page early
  and the tail of every list was lost with no error raised. Observed live on a
  26-item, three-page read. A total that computes to zero is no longer trusted
  once the current page is known non-empty.
- **`getDeliveryStatus()` could never succeed.** It sent `mobile`; the API
  requires `msisdn` and answered `FIELD_EMPTY` every time.
- **`SmsStatsData` reported `sent` and `optouts` as `0` always.** The API calls
  them `total` and `opt-outs` — hyphenated.
- **`BulkProgressData` reported every count as `0`, and `isComplete()` and
  `isProcessing()` were always `false`.** The API sends `importlength`,
  `completed` and `imported`, and its status strings are `completed` and
  `in progress`. Since polling this endpoint is the only way to learn whether a
  bulk import succeeded, a caller waiting for completion waited forever.
- **`SmsSentItemData` crashed with a `TypeError` on real rows.** The API sends
  `id`, `msisdn` and `sent_at`; the DTO expected `message_id`, `mobile` and
  `send_at`.
- **`MessageReportData::$totalCount` silently reported a page count as an
  account total.** It read `total_count`, which does not exist; the real keys
  are `messages_total` and `sms_total`.
- **V1 error responses escaped `catch (KudosityException)`.** Every resource
  used `dtoOrFail()`, so Saloon wrapped the real exception in its own
  `LogicException` — uncatchable by any documented handler. All six resources
  now route through `sendAndDto()`.

### Changed — behaviour

Three changes are observable. Each replaces wrong data or an uncatchable
failure with correct behaviour, so code that appears to break was already
broken; it simply could not tell.

- **V1 errors now throw `KudosityException`** across every resource, instead of
  Saloon's `LogicException`. A `catch (KudosityException $e)` block that never
  fired before will now fire.
- **`getContactStats()` now throws instead of returning zeros.** The endpoint
  returns a paginated per-message record list, not aggregate counts, so the DTO
  could never represent it and previously handed back `mobile: ""` with every
  count `0` — for every call, not an edge case. The exception explains the real
  shape. A paginated reader is planned for 2.1.0.
- **`getDeliveryStatus()`, `getMessageReport()`, `SmsStatsData` and
  `BulkProgressData` now return real values** where they previously returned
  zeros or crashed.

### Documentation

- **Reply correlation guidance corrected, and it was wrong in a way that
  mattered.** `CLAUDE.md` and the webhook fixture README told readers to route
  replies on `last_message.message_ref` *because* matching on the phone number
  "breaks when one contact is in two flows at once". Verified live: an SMS and
  an MMS sent seconds apart, the customer replied to the SMS, and the inbound
  event named the **MMS**. `last_message` identifies the most recent outbound to
  that number, so it has the same failure mode — and is worse for it, because it
  looks like per-message correlation and fails silently. `SignedMessageRef` does
  not rescue this: it protects the ref's integrity, not its identity.
- **The Laravel README's listener registration double-processed every webhook.**
  It documented explicit `Event::listen()` without noting that Laravel 11 and 12
  auto-discover class-based listeners, so a consumer using a listener class
  received every event twice.

### Known issue

- **Laravel 13 is not supported.** The Laravel package requires
  `illuminate/* ^11.0||^12.0`, so `composer require` on a fresh Laravel 13
  install fails outright. Deliberately not changed in a patch release: widening
  the constraint requires testing against Laravel 13 rather than editing a
  version string. **Resolved in 2.1.0** — see above.

## 2.0.1 - 2026-08-07

Metadata only — no code changes from 2.0.0.

### Changed

- Each package now declares a `replace` for the 1.x name it was renamed from, so a dependency graph still referencing `expertsystemsau/transmitsms-php-client` or `expertsystemsau/transmitsms-laravel-client` resolves to the 2.x package instead of installing both side by side. Note that the namespace changed in 2.0, so a package requiring the old name is satisfied by the replace but will not find the old classes — run the codemod, and see UPGRADING.md.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-08-07

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/expertsystemsau/kudosity-php-sdk/compare/v1.9.0...v2.0.0

### Breaking

- Renamed the packages: `expertsystemsau/transmitsms-php-client` is now `expertsystemsau/kudosity-php-client`, and `expertsystemsau/transmitsms-laravel-client` is now `expertsystemsau/kudosity-laravel-client`. The old packages are abandoned and point at the replacements.
- Renamed the namespace `ExpertSystems\TransmitSms\` to `ExpertSystems\Kudosity\`.
- Renamed `TransmitSmsClient` to `KudosityClient`, `TransmitSmsConnector` to `KudosityV1Connector`, `TransmitSmsRequest` to `KudosityV1Request`, `TransmitSmsException` to `KudosityException`, `TransmitSmsPaginator` to `V1PagedPaginator`, `TransmitSmsServiceProvider` to `KudosityServiceProvider`, `TransmitSmsChannel` to `KudosityChannel`, `TransmitSmsMessage` to `KudosityMessage`, and the `TransmitSms` facade to `Kudosity`.
- Renamed the notification method `toTransmitSms()` to `toKudosity()` and the channel string `'transmitsms'` to `'kudosity'`.
- Renamed the config file `config/transmitsms.php` to `config/kudosity.php`, its publish tag `transmitsms-config` to `kudosity-config`, and every `TRANSMITSMS_*` environment variable to `KUDOSITY_*`. The default webhook prefix moved from `webhooks/transmitsms` to `webhooks/kudosity`.
- Renamed `KudosityException::fromResponse()` to `fromV1Response()`, making room for the V2 error format. The identically named factories on the `Data\*` DTOs are unchanged.
- Removed `useSmsUrl()` and `useMmsUrl()` from the client and connector, and the `BASE_URL_MMS` constant. `BASE_URL_SMS` is now `BASE_URL`. Nothing in the SDK ever issued a request against the MMS host; V2 support arrives with a dedicated connector.
- `KudosityClient` now holds two connectors. `v1()` and `v2()` return them; `connector()` still returns the V1 connector. `fromConnector()` takes a V1 connector as before, and `fromConnectors()` accepts either or both. The constructor's `$baseUrl` parameter is replaced by `$v1BaseUrl` and `$v2BaseUrl`, and `$apiSecret` is now optional — omit it for V2-only use. `setBaseUrl()` is now `setV1BaseUrl()`, with the old name delegating to it.
- Removed `KudosityClient::sms()`. The V1 send surface is `bulk()`, the reply readers moved to `reporting()`, and the API-backed `formatNumber()` moved to `numbers()`. `sms()` returns in the next release as the V2 single-recipient API. See UPGRADING.md.
- A V1 call with no API secret now throws `KudosityException` explaining that V1 needs both credentials, instead of failing with a 401 from the API.

### Added

- `rename-map.json` and `bin/kudosity-codemod`, which rewrite a consuming project's class references, notification hook, channel string, config keys, environment variables and composer requirements. Dry-run by default.
- `UPGRADING.md`.
- `KudosityV2Connector` for the V2 API (`api.transmitmessage.com`, `x-api-key`), with `KudosityV2Request` as the JSON-body request base.
- `KudosityException::fromV2Response()` maps V2's RFC 9457 Problem Details onto typed exceptions, adding `NotFoundException` and `ServerException`, and exposes every failed field via `getIssues()`.
- `V2PagedPaginator` and `V2CursorPaginator` for V2's two pagination schemes, selected by the `PaginatesV2Pages` and `PaginatesV2Cursor` contracts.
- `BulkSmsResource::schedule()` makes a scheduled V1 send explicit.
- `Concerns\HasRetryPolicy`, `Concerns\UnwrapsData` and `Concerns\FormatsPhoneNumbers`.
- `KudosityClient::sms()`, `mms()`, `whatsapp()` and `rcs()` — the four V2 channels, each lazily built against `v2()` and returning typed DTOs. `sms()` returns with different semantics than the method 1.x removed: it now wraps `POST /v2/sms`, a single-recipient send with no scheduling — see UPGRADING.md before repointing multi-recipient 1.x `sms()` call sites at it.
- `Resources\SmsV2Resource`, `MmsResource`, `WhatsAppResource` and `RcsResource`, with their request classes under `Requests\V2\`. SMS lists page by page; WhatsApp and RCS lists page by cursor; both go through Phase 2's paginators.
- `Enums\MessageStatus` and `Enums\RcsCapabilityCode` — tolerant enums whose `fromApi()` resolves an undocumented value to `Unknown` rather than throwing, so a client reading its own message history doesn't break when Kudosity adds a status.
- `Contracts\WhatsAppContent` and its three variants, `Data\V2\Content\TextContent`, `TemplateContent` and `CustomContent`, plus `Data\V2\SmsFallback` for the `sms_fallback` object shared by the WhatsApp and RCS send endpoints.
- `Data\V2\SmsMessageData`, `MmsMessageData`, `WhatsAppMessageData`, `RcsMessageData`, `RcsCapabilityData` and `SmsListData` DTOs. SMS and MMS responses are flat; WhatsApp and RCS are wrapped in `data` — both resolved through the same `Concerns\UnwrapsData::payload()` seam.
- `KudosityClient::webhooks()` and `senders()`, plus `@method` entries on the facade.
- `Resources\WebhooksResource` — account-level webhook CRUD over `POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /v2/webhook`, with `Data\V2\WebhookData` and `Data\V2\WebhookFilter`. **V2 has no per-send callback URL**, so this replaces V1's `dlr_callback` / `reply_callback` for V2 sends — see UPGRADING.md.
- `Webhooks\WebhookEvent::fromArray()` turns a delivered payload into one of `StatusEvent`, `InboundEvent`, `LinkHitEvent`, `OptOutEvent` or `UnknownEvent`, with `Webhooks\SourceMessage` for the message-shaped object they attach. `messageRef()` is a single accessor for the correlation key, which the API puts at a different path per event type. `raw` keeps the payload verbatim.
- `Enums\WebhookEventType` (ten types), `Enums\OptOutSource`, `Enums\SenderStatus`, `Enums\SenderRegistrationType` and `Enums\SenderVerificationMethod` — all tolerant, all resolving an undocumented value to `Unknown`.
- `Webhooks\StatusPrecedence` — the ordering and idempotency guard for status events. Multiple events fire per message, order is not guaranteed and deliveries are at-least-once, so a late `SENT` must never overwrite a recorded `DELIVERED`. It is a rank rather than a terminal-status check, because an RCS `READ` legitimately follows `DELIVERED`.
- `Webhooks\SignedMessageRef` — signs and verifies the `message_ref`. Kudosity does **not** sign webhook deliveries, so this is the only authenticity signal available to a receiver: it proves a delivery refers to one of your own entities. It protects correlation, not the payload.
- `Resources\SendersResource` — sender registrations and the SMS verification flow, with `Data\V2\SenderRegistrationData`. `SenderStatus::isReadyToUse()` exists because `VERIFIED` means *provisioning*: only `READY_TO_USE` can send. Note this endpoint registers a **personal mobile number** and is not the route to an alphanumeric sender ID, a WhatsApp Business sender or an RCS agent.
- `Concerns\ParsesV2Timestamps` and `Concerns\GuardsMessageRef`, each replacing four verbatim copies. `MAX_MESSAGE_REF_LENGTH` moved onto the latter and remains reachable as `SendSmsV2Request::MAX_MESSAGE_REF_LENGTH` and friends.
- Laravel: `base_url` config is now keyed by API version (`v1`/`v2`), and a config still carrying the flat string throws on boot rather than sending V2 traffic to the V1 host. `KudosityV2Connector` is registered as a singleton — it cannot autowire — and the client is built from both configured connectors, so `kudosity.timeout` now reaches V2.
- Laravel: three new notification channels — `kudosity-mms`, `kudosity-whatsapp` and `kudosity-rcs` — with `KudosityMmsMessage`, `KudosityWhatsAppMessage` and `KudosityRcsMessage`, plus per-channel sender config.
- Laravel: `KudosityChannel` routes to V2 by default and to V1 only for options V2 cannot express, reporting the decision through `KudosityMessage::apiVersion()` and `v1Reasons()`. `forceV2()` throws rather than dropping a V1-only option. **`send()` now returns `?SentMessage`** rather than `?SmsData`.
- Laravel: `POST {prefix}/events` receives all ten V2 webhook event types and dispatches `KudosityStatusReceived`, `KudosityInboundReceived`, `KudosityLinkHitReceived` or `KudosityOptOutReceived`. Authenticated by unguessable URL, since V2 deliveries are unsigned; an unsigned request is refused with 403 even though the V1 parser would allow it. A plaintext `http://` webhook URL is refused unless `allowInsecureUrl: true` is passed; `kudosity:webhook:install` opts in only when `APP_ENV=local`. The three V1 GET callback routes are unchanged.
- `Contracts\SentMessage`, implemented by `Data\SmsData` and `Data\V2\SmsMessageData`, so the SMS channel's return type is stable across its routing decision.
- `V2PagedPaginator` now also reads a total from `meta.pagination.total_count` and prefers the `limit` a response reports. `GET /v2/senders/registrations` is page-based but names its total differently from `GET /v2/sms` and defaults to 25 per page rather than 100.
- `Webhooks\InboundMedia` and `InboundEvent::$media` — an inbound MMS delivers its attachment as **inline base64** under `mo.media[]`, not as URLs. `InboundEvent::$contentUrls` reads `mo.content_urls`, which is the *outbound* request shape and is absent from a real `MMS_INBOUND`, so the picture parsed cleanly and was silently discarded. Captured live on 2026-08-06; see `packages/kudosity-client/tests/Fixtures/V2Webhooks/README.md`. `InboundMedia::mimeType()` sniffs the decoded bytes because the payload carries no content type at all, and `bytes()` returns null rather than throwing on content that will not decode.
- The client package ships its own PHPUnit 11 suite, installed and run standalone on PHP 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4. Previously nothing executed the declared `^8.2` floor — Pest 4 requires 8.3 — and nothing proved the package installs without Laravel. PHPStan now analyses the whole declared range, so 8.3-only syntax fails review rather than a consumer's runtime.
- `Requests\V2\CheckRcsCapabilitiesRequest` now throws `ValidationException` (`FIELD_INVALID`) from its constructor when `$sender` looks like a phone number, matching the guard `SendRcsRequest` already had — `rcs()->capabilities()` takes a registered agent ID, never a number. Previously such a call reached the live API and failed with the accurate but unhelpful `"sender is not owned by this account"`.

### Notes

- **Kudosity confirmed V2 webhook deliveries are unsigned** (2026-08-06). `x-transmitsms-signature` is V1-only and V2 support is on their roadmap; they recommend `message_ref` for correlation, which is what `Webhooks\SignedMessageRef` signs. Whether stable egress IP ranges exist for allowlisting is still an open question with them.
- Inbound MMS now works on a provisioned number. It produced no event at all during Phase 4; Kudosity replaced the account's virtual number, and the first reply to the replacement delivered. A number that sends MMS does not necessarily receive it.

## 1.9.0 - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- Paginated iteration silently returned zero items for every endpoint whose response envelope is not keyed `responses`. `TransmitSmsPaginator` hardcoded the `responses` key, so `numbers()->all()`, `lists()->all()`, `keywords()->all()`, and reporting `getSent()`/`getUserSent()` iterated to nothing. Each paginatable request now declares its own key (`numbers`, `lists`, `keywords`, `recipients`, `messages`, `members`, `responses`) via the new `ExpertSystems\TransmitSms\Contracts\PaginatesResults` interface, and the paginator reads it per request. Keys were verified against the official API documentation.
- `lists()->getContacts()` threw `InvalidArgumentException` because `GetListRequest` was not `Paginatable`. It now implements `PaginatesResults` and pages through the list's `members`.

### Changed

- CI: removed the `test-client` matrix (12 jobs) that ran PHPUnit against the client package's empty test directory under `continue-on-error: true`, masking the fact that it ran nothing. The client's classes are covered by the root Pest suite (`test-laravel` job).
- CI: documented why `split.yml` intentionally pins `actions/checkout@v4` — `splitsh-action@v1.0.0` unsets the inline `http.extraheader` auth token that checkout v4 writes, and checkout v5+ stores credentials differently, which breaks the split. It must stay on v4.

## 1.8.0 - 2026-07-03

### Breaking

- `SmsResource::send()` and `sendToList()` replace the positional `repliesToEmail` argument added in 1.7.0 with an optional `configure` closure that receives the `SendSmsRequest` after connector defaults are applied. Migrate `send($msg, $to, $from, $email)` to `send($msg, $to, $from, configure: fn ($r) => $r->repliesToEmail($email))`. The closure also reaches every other request option (callbacks, scheduling, validity, tracked links).
- Dropped Laravel 10 support. The Saloon v4 upgrade (`saloonphp/laravel-plugin ^4.0`) requires Laravel 11+, so the Laravel package now requires `illuminate/* ^11.0||^12.0`. The CI matrix and docs were updated to match.

### Added

- Laravel `TransmitSmsMessage::toList(int $listId)` — send a notification to a TransmitSMS contact list; the channel skips notifiable recipient resolution when a list is set.
- Laravel `TransmitSmsMessage::formatNumbers(bool)` — client-side E.164 number normalisation, wired through `TransmitSmsChannel`.

### Fixed

- Pagination threw `InvalidArgumentException` on every paginated call (`numbers()->all()`, `sms()->getResponses()`/`getAllResponses()`, `lists()->all()`, `keywords()->all()`, reporting `getSent()`/`getUserSent()`); all collection requests now implement Saloon's `Paginatable` interface.
